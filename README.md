# entropy-aging
Code repository for the project "DNA methylation entropy is a biomarker for epigenetic aging"

### Data folder ###
- datasets used in analysis. Of note is t.mat (which contains all the probe loci and their corresponding sequences) and master_dataset.mat (which contains all the methylation metrics of the probe loci across all 100 samples).

### Scripts folder ###
- contains all the necessary code to reproduce this experiment, along with code to produce the figures.

The sequencing data can be found at [this link ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1br48bruBny1aShHLbbXKrZ53NoHgO6qX?usp=sharing).
