# entropy-aging
Code repository for the project "DNA methylation entropy is a biomarker for epigenetic aging"

### Data folder ###
- bam: contains the .bam (and .bai) files used in data analysis. Ages of each sample are listed in the file sampleAges.m, which is in the Scripts folder.
- other files in this folder are non-MATLAB scripts used in data analysis. Of note is t.mat (which contains all the probe loci and their corresponding sequences) and master_dataset.mat (which contains all the methylation metrics of the probe loci across all 100 samples).

### Scripts folder ###
- contains all the necessary code to reproduce this experiment, along with code to produce the figures.
